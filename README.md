Hi!
Here are the steps to run the project successfully:
Step 1 : Download all the files(Angry , Sad, Happy, Neutral) and place them all in a Train folder.
Step 2 : Open MATLAB, Create a New Script and run the Train_code(Make sure the Train Folder and the MATLAB file is in the same folder).
Step 3 : After Running the Train_code, a Classifier file will saved in the same folder, which is needed for the Test_code.
Step 4 : Download 20 Songs(5 for Each Emotion) for Playing(U can input as many songs as u want, I used 5 for Each Emotion)(mp3 song recommanded).
Step 5 : Seperate those Songs into Different Folders(Angry , Sad, Happy, Neutral).
Step 6 : Create one more New Script and save it in the Same Folder as the other Script.
Step 7 : Now Run the Test_code.
Step 8 : Your Emotion will be detected using the WebCam and according to your Emotion a window will open displaying the song names, click any to play.

Hopefully this Steps are enough to run the project successfully.
